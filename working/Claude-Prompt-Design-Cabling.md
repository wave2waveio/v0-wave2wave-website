You are a world class product marketing person, an astute sales executive and a brilliant business person.  I want you to utilize the superpowers that are vested to you.

my business is a fiber optic, structured cabling manufacturing business. See the attached PDF of the overview of our products.  I have one component of my business that i need to build some marketing collateral (pitch deck, website, etc.).  I need to start with a high level one line value statement \- Design-Driven Cabling: transforming your 2D layouts and spreadsheets into digital twin models, custom-length cable kits, and port-level installation guides.

The component is a service that is our ability to help with the data center design aspect.  we can take in spreadsheets of a data center configuration (racks, servers, switches, ports, etc. detailed in a spreadsheet) along with a CAD or visio  tops down view of the rack layout and then create a 3D digital twin using Sunbird.  

We can then create an entire suite of deliverables out of this including:

* cable lengths/bundle calculations  
* a full BOM of all the cables for pricing  
* a single "Part number" for the PO,   
* a BOM of the cables organized by rack/server/port for shipping / delivery  
* installation guides for every cable in a spreadsheet organized by cable showing origination and destination rack/server/switch/port.  
* 3D visualization  
* spreadsheet with quality (insertion loss) test results of each and every cable organized by design

I have provided example documents:

* Brochure with an overview of my products and services  
* 2D tops down overview of the data center rack (4 NAU\_POS.E\_DH03\_SNP.RACK\_LAYOUT\_V1.pdf)  
* customer supplied layout in spreadsheet form (0 CG2 BOM WSE and SwarmX rack Configs  Wave2Wave.xlsx)  
* A detailed spreadsheet of the cabling lengths outputted by the DC twin software we created (W2WC123\_Cabling\_Length\_For\_Cerebras\_CG2\_V1.120231107.xlsx)  
* A truncated version of an engineering design deliverable with floorplan, cable lengths, all connections with the specific cables, diagrams and more (Engineering-Design-Services-Example.truncated.pdf)  
* Product drawings of the custom cable bundles we’re using for the rack connections (W2W-C123\_98CR50-8080CP-14-MGxxFT-C1\_REV1.0.pdf)  
* Testing report of the cable manufacturing (98CR-202291958-SWX001\~12.xlsx)  
* Cable length detailed spreadsheet with source/destination documentation and calculations (W2W-C123\_Cabling\_Length\_For\_Cerebras\_CG2\_V1.1-20231107.xlsx)  
* Installation guide \- a sample of one of many (SWX002 MPO Bundle Connecting Guide For CG2-20240119.pdf)  
* A 3D floor map view from the DCIM tool (2 Floor Map 3D View.png)

 

I need to create the following. User your superpower of writing, business, technical acumen to create a markdown file with the detailed content, messaging and positioning.

* Create a presentation for this service offering that can be used as a sales pitch. It needs to be relatively technical as the audience is IT and design engineers. Write the slide by slide pitch with headlines, the detailed narrative/bullet points.  Include placeholders with suggestions for imagery that could be screenshots from spreadsheets, design documents, 3D images, test reports, etc.  Keep the pitch tight in terms of length. This goal is not a long deck.  
    
* Create a one page narrative to include in my brochure. Include placeholders with suggestions for imagery that could be screenshots from spreadsheets, design documents, 3D images, test reports, etc. This will also be a technical sales brochure.  Utilize my one line value statement.  
    
* Develop a PRD for a webpage and subpages that walks through this entire value proposition and process.  This will be implemented on my website under a menu header “Data Center Design” or some other menu header that is better (please provide 2 or 3 examples).  Write all detailed content.  Provide placeholders for images.  The webpage should not have wild, bright colors. Use variations of my colors: 1\) Dark Charcoal Gray (\#333333) and Electric Blue (\#0072CE). User your superpower of a world class UI designer to create something that is compelling, easy to read/understand and also searchable.
