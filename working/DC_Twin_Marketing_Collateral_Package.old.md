## **DC Twin™ Engineering Services**

*From Floor Plan to Installation-Ready Cabling—Engineered, Manufactured, Documented*

### **The Challenge**

Modern data center builds demand precision. Hundreds of racks, thousands of ports, and cable runs that must be exactly right—wrong lengths mean rework, mismatched connections mean delays, and field labeling means errors. Traditional cabling approaches rely on bulk ordering and on-site improvisation. The result: cable chaos, installation delays, and infrastructure that's difficult to document or audit.

### **The Wave2Wave Solution: DC Twin™**

We take your data center design—your rack layout and configuration spreadsheets—and transform it into a precision-engineered cabling system, manufactured and delivered ready to install. Using our DC Twin™ platform, we build a complete 3D digital twin of your infrastructure. Every cable path is routed through your actual overhead trays and floor pathways. Every length is calculated from real routing—not straight-line estimates. Every connection is mapped from source port to destination port.

### **What You Receive**

* **3D Digital Twin** — Full visualization of your cabling infrastructure before manufacturing  
* **Calculated Cable Lengths** — Manufactured in 3-inch increments to match your pathway design  
* **Complete Bill of Materials** — One comprehensive BOM for pricing and procurement  
* **Single PO Part Number** — Order the entire system as one line item  
* **Rack-Organized Kitting** — Cables packaged by rack for sequential installation  
* **Port-Level Installation Guides** — Every cable documented with origin and destination  
* **Factory Test Reports** — 100% IL/RL tested with serialized results

*\[PLACEHOLDER: 3-column image strip showing 1\) 3D floor visualization, 2\) custom cable bundle photo, 3\) installation guide spreadsheet screenshot\]*

### **Installation Made Simple**

Your field team receives rack-ready kits organized by installation phase. Each cable is factory-labeled with its exact destination. Technicians simply match the label to the port—no interpretation, no field decisions, no errors. Installations that once took weeks now complete in days.

### **Quality You Can Verify**

Every cable assembly is 100% tested before shipment. Insertion loss, return loss, and continuity results are documented by serial number and mapped to your design. Issues surface at the factory—not in your data center.

### **One Partner. Complete Accountability.**

Wave2Wave isn't a reseller—we're an engineering company that designs, manufactures, and tests your cabling system end-to-end. From the first spreadsheet to the last test report, you work with one team who owns the outcome.

*\[PLACEHOLDER: Photo of bundled cables with Wave2Wave labeling OR 3D visualization detail\]*

### **Get Started**

Share your rack layout and configuration data. We'll build your digital twin, calculate your cable requirements, and deliver a complete proposal—typically within days.
